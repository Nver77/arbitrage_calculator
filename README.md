# Arbitrage Calculator

A simple Python project that calculates arbitrage opportunities based on given odds.

The goal of this project is to identify whether an arbitrage situation exists and, if so, calculate the optimal bet distribution and potential profit percentage.

This project focuses on core backend logic, calculations, and clean Python code.

##  What is Arbitrage?

Arbitrage is a betting strategy where different odds for all possible outcomes are used to guarantee a profit, regardless of the final result.

This calculator helps determine:
- Whether an arbitrage opportunity exists
- How to distribute bets correctly
- Expected profit percentage
